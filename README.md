# RWKV_Explained
RWKV, in easy to read code

Just some commented code you can read to get an understanding of how the newer versions of RWKV work.

Disclaimer: This code was designed for expository purposes, not for training or inference. It purposely trades optimality for readability.

For inference test, you can run `python inference.py model_path config_path`
You will find various related configs in the configs directory.
